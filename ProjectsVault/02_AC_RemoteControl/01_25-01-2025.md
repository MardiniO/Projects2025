- Learn IR transmitter and IR receiver library
- Attempt AC control with IR transmitter and receiver

### Remote Control Transceiver (RMT) Header File

The [RMT](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/api-reference/peripherals/rmt.html) peripheral can be used to transmit and receive many types of signals. Typically, the RMT peripheral can be used in the following scenarios:

- Transmitting or receiving infrared signals with any IR protocols.
- Generating sequences.
- Transmitting signals in a hardware-controlled loop.
- Multi-channel simultaneous transmission.
- Modulating the carrier to the output signal or demodulate the carrier from the input signal.

#### Modulation and Demodulation

- Modulation is the process of encoding information in a transmitted signal.
- Demodulation is the process of extracting information from the transmitted signal.

### Arduino IDE

Instead of ESP-IDF, I am looking into a replacement framework that has larger library support, in this case for IR communication.
